Hi Everyone, my name is Justin Tokuda. I decided to major in MIS because I was always interested in and fond of technology since I was young, and the career opportunities that are available to MIS majors intrigue me a lot. ITM 352 is essentially the starting point of an MIS major's path towards their degree, and I am taking this course with the hopes of becoming one myself in the near future.
